        "\n",
        "#2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "Exception handling in python is a processes of handling and resolving the error occurs in a program. This involves catching exceptions, understanding the problem and handling that accordingly.\n",

        "#3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "The purpose of finally block is to perform the clean up operations(closing files, database connections, etc) or performing other final actions and ensuring proper program termination.\n",
        "\n",
        "#4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "Logging in python refers to the process of recording the events that occue during the execution of a software program.It involves capturing and storing information about the program's behavior, including errors, warnings, informational messages, and debugging details.\n",
